## Basic Details

### Team Name: Cosmics

### Team Members
- Member 1: Bhavya.P - LBS College of Engineering,Kasaragod
- Member 2: Abhija Satheesh -LBS College of Engineering,Kasaragod

### Hosted Project Link
https://blood-donation-2g1q.vercel.app/

### Project Description
Blood Donation Finder is a website that helps patients and hospitals quickly find nearby blood donors based on blood group and location. Donors can register and update availability, and seekers can instantly search and contact matching donors during emergencies.

### The Problem statement
In Kerala, emergency blood requirements are usually handled through WhatsApp groups, Facebook posts, and personal contacts. Although Kerala has good healthcare facilities, patients still face serious difficulties in finding the right blood group donor quickly, especially during accidents, surgeries, childbirth complications, and cancer treatments.

### The Solution
Kerala needs a reliable web-based Blood Donation Finder system that allows donors to register and update availability, and enables patients/hospitals to quickly search for nearby donors based on blood group and location, ensuring faster response during emergencies.
